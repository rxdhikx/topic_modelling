# Instagram Post Topic Modeling and Dimensional Quantification - FLAN T LLM



- **Objective**: Analyze Instagram post data to identify key **themes and topics** from captions and user comments.
- **Data**: Excel file with multiple sheets, each representing a post (e.g., Netflix, Burberry, Ory), containing post captions and associated user comments.
- **Approach**: 
  - Utilized **Flan-T5**, a large pre-trained language model, for **topic modeling** to extract relevant themes from the captions and comments.
  - Implemented **batch processing** to efficiently handle large datasets and avoid memory overloads.
  - Leveraged **Google Colab's GPU resources** for faster model inference and processing.
- **Metrics**: 
  - Generated insights into user sentiment and engagement through basic **quantification of dimensions**.
  - Identified 5-6 core topics/themes for each post (e.g., fashion, product quality, customer service).
- **Outcome**: 
  - Provided actionable insights into audience sentiment and discussions around Instagram posts.
  - Demonstrated the effectiveness of **LLMs** in handling large-scale, unstructured text data for topic modeling and analysis.
